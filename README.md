# Hi there! I’m Sergi Juárez 👋

**Systems Software Engineer | Embedded & Low-Level Software | RISC-V | FPGA & HW/SW Interface**

I’m a systems-oriented engineer interested in working at the **intersection of software and hardware**. I’m currently focusing on **embedded and low-level systems**, with particular interest in **system bring-up**, **RISC-V architectures**, and the **hardware/software interface**.

> *“The best way to understand a system is to build it.”*

## 👨‍💻 About Me

### 🎓 Background

I come from a **dual educational path**:

- **UOC** — Computer Architecture & Operating Systems  
- **42 Barcelona** — intensive, peer-to-peer, project-based learning  

This combination shaped how I approach engineering problems: **self-driven learning**, deep debugging, and collaborative problem-solving in complex systems.

---

### 🚀 Current Focus — Hardware / Software Interface

I’m actively moving towards **Hardware–Software Co-Design**, approaching it primarily from the **software side**:

- Operating system internals  
- Embedded systems & bare-metal programming  
- Firmware development  
- RISC-V ISA and toolchains  

In parallel, I’m building hands-on experience on the **hardware side**:

- FPGA prototyping using **Verilog / SystemVerilog**
- Design exploration and simulation with **Vivado**
- Early system bring-up and validation
- Understanding how software stacks interact with hardware platforms  

To bridge both worlds, I’m prototyping designs on a **Xilinx FPGA**, focusing on reproducible workflows, clear documentation, and iterative testing. Seeing low-level software concepts materialize as real hardware has been a key learning experience.

I’m currently deepening my understanding of **RISC-V systems**, where my interests in operating systems, embedded software, and FPGA prototyping naturally converge, with the goal of contributing to the **open-source hardware ecosystem**.
